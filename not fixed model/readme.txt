error distribution: plot hitting point error distribution
plot distribution: plot model error distribution
XZ_hp_plane: plot prediction hitting point error in circle which means paddle contact range
training: training prediction model


----- jupyter notebook -----
boxplot_error: practice using box plot to plot model error distribution
classification: using increasing dataset training data and using culstm, model:256-8, batch=8000
increasing_datasets: using 30ball dataset which for classification to make increasing dataset 30balls-5balls
make classification dataset: read raw datasets and set label make 30balls classification dataset
make prediction dataset: read row dataset and random take 750 data split 500 for training 250 for testing
prediction: training prediction model , using 250 neurons
prediction_20200513: test using culstm make prediction model, using 128 neurons
prediction_single_direction: test using culstm make prediction model and using one dataset, using 256 neurons
simulation: calculate model prediction error and plot histgram
simulation-Copy1: using class calculate rolling error (3rd v.s. n-10) and plot histgram, try to make offline version
Untitled: try to make offline version and plot update error
Untitled1: using class to make offline version and calculate prediction error, plot result in circle
Untitled2: Untitle1 final version
